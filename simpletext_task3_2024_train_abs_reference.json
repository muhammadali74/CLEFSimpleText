For example, due to mobile devices' limitations, such as smaller screens and weaker processors (also called CPUs), software development for mobile applications is partially different from desktop applications. Designing an M-commerce system involves asking questions such as: \"What information do users want on mobile devices?\", \"How can we create useful apps with limited user input?\", and \"How do we test a distributed M-commerce system?\" In this paper, we share our experiences developing an M-commerce system for tourists and discuss software development issues for such systems.

Instead of making this trade-off, we suggest using a straightforward object-oriented framework for content adaptation. To make this framework more accessible for use on the web, we build our approach on the object-oriented WebComposition model and its implementation, WCML, which is an application of XML.

A BAN refers to a network of wearable or implantable devices worn on or attached to the human body for various purposes. Timely and context-aware delivery of data is crucial. This paper presents a system specifically designed for patients with cardiac disorders, focusing on the design of the sensing device and communication scheme selected. Many of the current wearable physiological devices used in healthcare systems, known as Patient Sensing Devices (PSD), are bulky and uncomfortable for elderly patients due to their inflexible design. We introduce a unique Patient Sensing Device (PSD) that is both flexible and detachable, designed for patient comfort.

We have developed and implemented a proof-of-concept prototype that can transmit a patient's Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and body temperature, potentially expanding to other vital signs. Communication between a mobile smartphone and the ECG and temperature acquisition apparatus is achieved via Bluetooth.

(Smart cards are small, portable devices that have a special chip inside. They can store and process information securely.) Without a way to keep the owner updated, it becomes challenging to take advantage of the useful features of smart cards. We look at how smart cards and powerful machines can be combined to make even better devices. We believe that Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) are more useful than smartcards because they can extend the user's private sphere. PDAs have enough functionality and resources to create trustworthy digital signatures, which can speak for the user. A less resourceful machine can serve as a memory aid, assisting the owner in remembering addresses and phone numbers, such as [121]. These machines are designed to be tamper-resistant, making them suitable for a minimalistic purpose. To create trustworthy digital signatures, a smartcard needs support from infrastructure outside the card itself. This is because the user is not aware of what information is given to the card, making it impossible for the card to be trusted solely on its own. We investigate the necessary components of this infrastructure and show that reliable digital signatures can indeed be created using a standard method [211]. We propose that smartcards can be utilized to build nontrivial distributed systems, where smartcard holders are considered important participants or \"first class citizens\". Claiming that smartcards can function as trusted machines opens up fresh possibilities for designers focused on user-centric approaches. It is evident that smartcards are here to stay, so it is wise for designers to explore and implement them in meaningful ways."},{"abs_id":"G01.1_1508161316","simplified_abs":"This paper introduces a new tele-assistance service for elderly people that goes beyond existing services by offering high-quality assistance anywhere and anytime.

We conducted a randomized, controlled trial in a university-based resident clinic. Residents in internal medicine were given a CDSS suite based on PDA. Intervention residents were provided with a CDSS that had a prediction rule for assessing gastrointestinal risk related to NSAIDs and recommendations for treatment. Trained individuals, known as standardized patients (SPs), who were equipped with musculoskeletal symptoms, interacted with the physicians participating in the study without prior notification. The study evaluated the safety outcomes of prescriptions given to standardized patients portraying musculoskeletal symptoms. A committee of clinicians who didn't know about the participant, intervention group assignment, or the baseline or follow-up data reviewed each prescription. They determined whether a prescription was safe or unsafe. The study aimed to see if the PDA-based CDSS would result in a reduction of unsafe prescribing of NSAIDs. The main outcome measured the difference in unsafe prescribing between the intervention and control groups. At the beginning of the study, both groups had a similar proportion of unsafe prescriptions. (0.27 vs 0.29) After controlling for the baseline performance, it was found that those who received the CDSS suite prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs more safely than those who didn't (0.23 vs 0.45, with statistical significance). Participants who had access to the CDSS through a PDA documented a more comprehensive assessment of gastrointestinal risk in patients.

To this day, long-term adaptations in strength are thought to be related to changes in muscle size. Given this assumption, training programs made for increasing both muscle size and strength were popular. However, the conclusion that a change in muscle size has an influence on strength is surprisingly based on little evidence. We suggest that these changes may be based on: (1) the weak correlation between the change in muscle size and the change in muscle strength after training; (2) the loss of muscle mass with the interruption of training, yet a maintenance of muscle strength; and (3) the similar muscle growth between low-load and high-load strength training, yet different results in strength."},{"abs_id":"M11_43","simplified_abs":"Low-intensity occlusion training, which is a training method with blood flow restriction, provides a unique beneficial training mode for muscle growth.

The metabolic accumulation causes positive physiologic reactions, specifically a rise in growth hormone, which is one of the main hormone responsible of muscle growth, that is higher than levels found with higher intensities.

However, the effect of cycling training on muscle size and strength still requires a better comprehension. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to discuss the effects of cycling training on muscle size and strength of the legs and the possible mechanisms for increasing muscle size with cycling training. It is plausible that cycling training requires a longer period to significantly increase muscle size compared to strength training due to a much slower muscle growth rate. Cycling training induces muscle growth similarly between young and older people, while strength gain seems to favor older adults. For young adults, series of high-intensity cycling may be required to achieve strength gains.

For vertebrates, it has been said that it occurs only in the brain. This review describes a cellular memory in muscles in which muscle growth is 'remembered' such that a fibre that has lost its mass, can regain it faster than untrained fibres. A new model, with the most reliable methods for identifying myonuclei (nuclei in muscle fiber), can explain this phenomenon. According to this model, previously untrained fibres recruit myonuclei from activated satellite cells (quiescent cells acting as a reserve population of cells for regeneration of muscle) before muscle growth. Even after grave muscle loss, the higher number of myonuclei is retained, and the myonuclei seem to be protected against programmed cell death observed during muscle loss. Fibres that have acquired a higher number of myonuclei grow faster during strength exercise, thus the nuclei represent a functionally important 'memory' of previous strength. This memory might be very long lasting in humans, as myonuclei are stable for at least 15 years and might even be permanent. However, myonuclei are harder to recruit for old people, and if the long-lasting muscle memory also exists in humans, one should consider early strength training as a public health advice."},{"abs_id":"M18_50","simplified_abs":"It has been hypothesized that eating small, frequent meals enhances fat loss and helps for better weight maintenance.

We present evidence that strength training can attenuate age-related changes in mobility, including improvements in walking speed, static and dynamic balance, and fall risk reduction. Older adults should be encouraged to participate in strength training activities, and should avoid immobility."},{"abs_id":"M21_53","simplified_abs":"Maximizing the muscle growth following strength training can be done by manipulating variables like exercise selection, exercise order, rest intervals, intensity of maximal load, and training volume (number of exercises, sets, etc.). A neglected variable that also may impact muscle growth is repetition duration. Total duration of a repetition is the sum of the contraction, the lengthening and isometric (static contraction) and is based on the tempo. We conducted a review and analysis of multiple studies to determine if modification of repetition duration can amplify the muscle growth. Results indicate that muscle growth is similar when training with repetition durations from 0.5 to 8 s. Using a wide range of repetition durations can be employed if the primary goal is to maximize muscle growth. Findings suggest that training at very slow durations (>10s per repetition) is less efficient for muscle growth, although a lack of studies on the topic makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions."},{"abs_id":"M22_54","simplified_abs":"Recovery from exercise refers to the time period between the end of exercise and the return to a resting or recovered state. It also refers to specific physiological processes occurring after exercise. Recovery of the cardiovascular system occurs across a period of minutes to hours, during which many characteristics of the system change over time. Some of these changes may be necessary for long-term adaptation to exercise training, yet some can lead to cardiovascular instability during recovery. These changes may provide insight into when the cardiovascular system has recovered and is physiologically ready for additional training. This review focuses on the most consistently observed blood flow adjustments and the causes that drive cardiovascular recovery and how they differ following strength and cardio exercise. First we focus on the effect leading to low blood pressure of cardio and strength exercise and associated mechanisms, which can progress to symptomatic hypotension (low blood pressure) and fainting. Finally, we focus on the practical application to maximize the benefits of cardiovascular recovery, or minimize the vulnerabilities. We will explore measures, and discuss how these can guide an athlete's training."},{"abs_id":"M23_55","simplified_abs":"Exercise and physical activity are key tools in the treatment and prevention of several medical conditions including joint disorders and diabetes. Exercise can reduce cardiovascular risk, inflammation, illness causing muscle loss, and hypertension, in addition to increasing physical functioning, strength, and cardio-respiratory capacity. Chronic kidney disease, a condition that affects around 10% of the population, is often neglected as a target for exercise-based therapy. Despite the vast range of severity in kidney disease, exercise has a potential role in all patients suffering from the condition. In this review, we summarise the potential important role of exercise in the management of kidney disease and how this form of 'medicine' should be used."},{"abs_id":"M24_56","simplified_abs":"Exercise with blood flow restriction (BFR) is used to increase strength in healthy individuals. However, its effects on individuals with knee pain are unknown. The objective is to determine the effectiveness of adding BFR to strength exercise for pain relief and improvement of function in patients with knee pain. We conducted a review and analysis of multiple studies. Studies that compared strength exercise with or without BFR to treat knee pain and function. The results showed that resistance exercises with BFR was not more effective than strength exercises for reducing pain and improving knee function in patients with knee pain."},{"abs_id":"M25_57","simplified_abs":"In Japan, 43 million patients had high blood pressure in 2010. The management of this condition and the importance of lifestyle changes for the prevention and treatment of high blood pressure has been recognized in Japan. In particular, increasing the levels of activities of daily living and physical exercise. In this review, we examined appropriate exercise prescriptions (e.g., type, intensity, duration per session, and frequency) for the prevention and treatment of high blood pressure. This review recommends full body cardio exercise at moderate intensity (i.e., 50-65% of maximum intensity, 30-60 min per session, 3-4 times a week) that focuses on the major muscle groups. Strength exercise should be performed at low-intensity without breath-holding and should be used as supplementary exercise, but it is contraindicated in patients with high blood pressure who have chest symptoms such as chest pain."},{"abs_id":"M2_34","simplified_abs":"Physical activity has many benefits like preventing diseases and improving general health. In popular opinion, it is recommended to start intense physical activities like weight lifting and plyometrics (exercises like sprint and jumps) after adolescence. But this advice does not seem to be based on facts. We did not find any recommendation against strength training at a young age if it is well supervised with safety rules, medical clearance, proper instruction from a professional and progressive overload (gradual increase of stress on muscle and nervous system). Several studies showed many benefits of repeated, intense physical efforts in young people. Improved motor skills and body composition (muscle mass increased, fat mass decreased, healthier bone) were found in studies, especially if sport practice began during puberty. We can conclude that strength training is a safe and healthy practice for children and adolescents."},{"abs_id":"M3_35","simplified_abs":"Nowadays, people are interested in intermittent fasting (an eating pattern where you cycle between periods of eating and fasting) Nutrition is important for the optimization of sport performance so there is a concern about the effects of intermittent fasting on performance. Studies showed that there are no benefit in high-intensity, endurance or strength training while fasting."},{"abs_id":"M4_36","simplified_abs":"Physically active people encounter periods with limited time available for exercise. During such periods, the goal of training may be to simply maintain physical performance. Some people may also desire to maintain performance for prolonged periods, like athletes during competitive season or militaries during deployment. Endurance performance can be maintained for up to 15 weeks with 2 trainings per week, or with a reduction of 13\u201326 minutes per training, as long as exercise intensity (exercising heart rate) is maintained. Strength and muscle size can be maintained for up to 32 weeks with 1 strength training per week and 1 set per exercise, as long as exercise intensity (load) is maintained. In older populations, maintaining muscle size may require up to 2 trainings per week and 2\u20133 sets per exercise, while maintaining exercise intensity. Exercise intensity seems to be the key variable for maintaining physical performance, even with reduction of frequency and volume (number of exercises, sets, etc.)"},{"abs_id":"M5_37","simplified_abs":"Nutrient timing is a popular nutritional strategy that involves the consumption of combinations of nutrients around an exercise session. Some people say that this approach can produce dramatic improvements in body composition. It has even been hypothesized that the timing may be more important than the total daily intake of nutrients. The post-exercise period is considered the most important part of nutrient timing. In theory, consuming the proper ratio of nutrients during this time allows the rebuilding of damaged muscle tissue and restoration of energy reserves, but also enhances both body composition and exercise performance. Researchers have made reference to an anabolic \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d (a limited time after training to optimize muscular adaptations). However, the importance - and even the existence - of a post-exercise \u2018window\u2019 can vary according to a number of factors. Research is uncertain about the applicability of nutrient timing. Besides, the relevance of post-exercise nutritional intake concerning anabolism (increasing muscle mass) has been challenged by recent evidence."},{"abs_id":"M6_38","simplified_abs":"Lack of time is one of the most common reason for not exercising. The aim of this review was to determine how strength training can be time-efficient by evaluating research on training variables, advanced training techniques, and the need for warm-up and stretching. We recommend choosing bilateral (with the two arms or legs), multi-joint (multiple joints involved) exercises that include full dynamic movements and to perform a minimum of one leg pressing exercise (e.g. squats), one pulling exercise (e.g. pull-up) and one pushing exercise (e.g. bench press). Exercises can be performed with machines and\/or free weights. Weekly training volume (number of exercises, sets, etc.) is more important than training frequency and we recommend a minimum of 4 weekly sets per muscle group using a load that permits to do 6 to 15 repetitions. Advanced training techniques like combining exercises with no rest or shortening the rest time while using lighter weights can cuts the training time in half, while maintaining training volume. However, these methods are probably better to increase muscle mass than strength. Finally, we advise exercise-specific warm-ups, and stretching only if the goal of training is to increase flexibility."},{"abs_id":"M7_39","simplified_abs":"Training frequency is an important variable for hypertrophy (increasing muscle mass) in strength training. The purpose of this paper was to conduct a review and analysis of multiple studies investigating the effects of weekly training frequency on hypertrophy. Results showed no significant difference between higher and lower frequency with the same training volume (number of exercises, sets, etc.). Analysis of studies with different training volumes showed better results for higher frequencies, although the difference between frequencies of 1 and 3+ days per week was small. In conclusion, there is strong evidence that resistance training frequency does not significantly impact muscle hypertrophy when training volume is the same. Thus, for a given training volume, individuals can choose a weekly frequency per muscle groups based on personal preference."},{"abs_id":"M8_40","simplified_abs":"A variety of training techniques have been suggested to support muscle growth. Forced repetitions\/drop sets (use lighter weight or receiving help to continue the set), supersets (combining exercises with no rest), and heavy negatives (lowering phase of the lift), are pretended to enhance hypertrophy (increasing muscle mass). This article will explore the potential role of these techniques in promoting muscle hypertrophy and provide an insight into possible applications to strength training."},{"abs_id":"M9_41","simplified_abs":"Increasing muscle mass is the goal of many people who lift weights. Research is lacking, however, as to the optimal way to induce muscle growth. Bodybuilders train with moderate loads and short rest intervals. Powerlifters, on the other hand, train with high-intensity loads and lengthy rest periods. Although both groups are known to display impressive muscularity, it is not clear which method is superior for increasing muscle mass. It has been shown that many factors mediate the process of muscle growth and that mechanical tension, muscle damage, and metabolic stress all can play a role in muscle growth. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to review the literature as to the mechanisms of muscle hypertrophy and their application to exercise training and to draw conclusions from the research as to the optimal way to induce muscle growth."}]
